# Prep Vs Play

This is a simulation I'm developing to expore the relationship between preparation and action (i.e. which is more effective) under differing situations.

There are a number of factors that can be configured on the game class to change the situation (cost of failure, rewards of success, multivariancy, etc.), and there exists the ability to create players of different behavioural leanings (i.e. more willing to attempt, or more interested in preparation).
